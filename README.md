Course Project: Artificial Intelligence Prototype
By Doha Hammouda

Project Description:

This project transcribes English audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper and translates it to German using MarianMT. 
It evaluates performance using: 

WER (Word Error Rate) for transcription accuracy
BLEU score (Billingual Evaluation Understudy) for translation quality.

Example:

Input: generated_audio4_mp3 with the joke "I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. it's impossible to put down"

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2fe6946-a237-4240-b92c-bd7fa4353615" />

output: The first audio transcription was done with a high precision, but in the translation the module struggled to find a translation for the joke. 
It translated only a part of the joke as the joke was dependant on the english word play.
